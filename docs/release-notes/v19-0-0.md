# Keycloak-Angular v19 🚀

We’re thrilled to release **Keycloak-Angular v19**, packed with modern features and improvements for Angular applications. 🎉

## ✨ Key Highlights

- **Functional Configuration**: Simplify setup with `provideKeycloak`—no more `KeycloakService` or `KeycloakAngularModule`.
- **Angular Signals**: Reactive handling of Keycloak events for a cleaner, modern approach.
- **Enhanced Interceptors**: Add tokens with explicit configuration using `includeBearerTokenInterceptor` and `customBearerTokenInterceptor`.
- **Role-Based Rendering**: New `*kaHasRoles` directive for conditional rendering based on roles.
- **Modular Features**: Introduced `withAutoRefreshToken` for seamless token refresh and session management.
- **Functional Route Guards**: Create custom guards with `createAuthGuard` for streamlined route protection.

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- Deprecated `KeycloakService`, `KeycloakAngularModule`, `KeycloakAuthGuard`, and `keycloakEvents$`.
- Bearer tokens are no longer added automatically to all HTTP requests—explicit configuration required.

## 🛠️ Legacy Version Still Bundled

The legacy implementation of Keycloak-Angular (`KeycloakService`, `KeycloakAngularModule`, etc.) is still bundled in this release for backward compatibility. However, **it is deprecated** and will be removed in a future major version. We strongly encourage migrating to the new APIs.

## 🛠️ Migration Guide

- Migrate to `provideKeycloak` for setup.
- Replace RxJS-based `keycloakEvents$` with Angular Signals.
- Use `*kaHasRoles` for role-based DOM rendering.
