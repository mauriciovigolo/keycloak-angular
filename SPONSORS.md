# Sponsorship Policy

## Purpose

Sponsorships support the maintenance and long-term sustainability of the **keycloak-angular** project.

Funds are used to cover:

- Ongoing maintenance and bug fixes
- Compatibility updates for new Angular and Keycloak versions
- Documentation and developer experience improvements

## What Sponsorship Does Not Provide

- Sponsors do not receive governance control
- Sponsorship does not guarantee feature prioritization
- Sponsorship does not include private support or SLAs

## Project Direction

Project direction and technical decisions remain community-driven and aligned with the project's goals.

## Transparency

Sponsorship does not affect licensing.  
The project will remain open source under its existing license.

## Acknowledgement

Sponsors are acknowledged publicly (for example, in the README) by default.  
If a sponsor prefers not to be publicly listed, they may request to opt out of public acknowledgment.
